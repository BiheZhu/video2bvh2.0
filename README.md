https://github.com/Dene33/video_to_bvh's but with python 3 and tensorflow2.0

Uses [Openpose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) to crop frames around a single person and then uses [hmr2.0](https://github.com/russoale/hmr2.0) by [Russoale](https://github.com/russoale) to get 3D pose keypoints. Then, using [Dene33](https://github.com/Dene33/)'s fork of [hmr](https://github.com/Dene33/hmr), the 3D pose keypoints are converted to bvh.

![Demo gif](media/rough_demo.gif)

Input video is [Man dancing on rooftop](https://www.pexels.com/video/man-dancing-on-rooftop-2795750/) by [cottonbro](https://www.pexels.com/@cottonbro). The bvh on the left is lagging slightly behind the video on the right. Will upload better demo videos later.

To Do:

 - [ ] Apply filters to smoothen the wobblyness
 - [ ] Add support for multiple videos at once
 - [ ] If I get time, Dash inline application.
